## _OS for FPGAs_

Framework providing operating system abstractions and a range of shared networking (*RDMA*, *TCP/IP*) and memory services to common modern heterogeneous platforms.

Some of Coyote's features:
 * Multiple isolated virtualized vFPGA regions
 * Dynamic reconfiguration 
 * RTL and HLS user logic coding support
 * Unified host and FPGA memory with striping across virtualized DRAM channels
 * TCP/IP service
 * RDMA service
 * HBM support
 * Runtime scheduler for different host user processes

## Prerequisites

Full `Vivado/Vitis` suite is needed to build the hardware side of things. Hardware server will be enough for deployment only scenarios. Coyote runs with `Vivado 2022.1`. Previous versions can be used at one's own peril.  

Following AMD platforms are supported: `vcu118`, `Alveo u50`, `Alveo u55c`, `Alveo u200`, `Alveo u250` and `Alveo u280`. Coyote is currently being developed on the HACC cluster at ETH Zurich. For more information and possible external access check out the following link: https://systems.ethz.ch/research/data-processing-on-modern-hardware/hacc.html


`CMake` is used for project creation. Additionally `Jinja2` template engine for Python is used for some of the code generation. The API is writen in `C++`, 17 should suffice (for now).

## System `HW`

The following picture shows the high level overview of Coyote's hardware architecture.

## System `SW`

Coyote contains the following software layers, each adding higher level of abstraction and parallelisation potential:

1. **cService** - Coyote daemon, targets a single *vFPGA*. Library of loadable functions and scheduler for submitted user tasks.
1. **cProc** - Coyote process, targets a single *vFPGA*. Multiple *cProc* objects can run within a single *vFPGA*.
2. **cThread** - Coyote thread, running on top of *cProc*. Allows the exploration of task level parallelisation.
3. **cTask** - Coyote task, arbitrary user variadic function with arbitrary parameters executed by *cThreads*.

# How to run it
Added/Modified by Shien 2024-02-20

## Init
 - Book a server alveo-u55c-03/04/05/â€¦ running Vivado 2022.1  
   Booking address https://hacc-booking.inf.ethz.ch/index.php 
 - Login to build servers first. They are faster than those with FPGAs
 - Add bashrc to source **Vivado 2022.1** upon login
 - Clone the mem_bypass branch
~~~~
$ ssh -x shizhu@alveo-u55c-03.inf.ethz.ch

# .bashrc
# Xilinx Tools (XRT, Vivado, Vitis, Vitis_HLS) need to be enabled for proper operation:

#### Create the shell and the project (10-30 minues) :
~~~~
$ make shell
zhu@hacc-build-01:~/Coyote/hw/build$ make shell 
~~~~

The project is created once the above command completes. Arbitrary user logic can then be inserted. If any of the existing examples are chosen, nothing needs to be done at this step.

User logic wrappers can be found under build project directory in the **hdl/config_X** where **X** represents the chosen PR configuration. Both HLS and HDL wrappers are placed in the same directories.

copy the user defined logic (No need if use the automated user_logic insertion)  
to /home/shizhu/Coyote/hw/build/lynx/hdl/  
-- config_0: Should be the user logic code  
-- wrappers  
|--common  
|--config_0: Should be the user logic wrapper  

~~If multiple PR configurations are present it is advisable to put the most complex configuration in the initial one (**config_0**). Additional configurations can always be created with `make dynamic`. Explicit floorplanning should be done manually after synthesis (providing default floorplanning generally makes little sense).~~

Project can always be managed from Vivado GUI, for those more experienced with FPGA design flows.


#### When the user design is ready, compilation can be started with the following command (1-3 hours):
~~~~
$ make compile
zhu@hacc-build-01:~/Coyote/hw/build$ make compile 
~~~~
Once the compilation finishes the initial bitstream with the static region can be loaded to the FPGA via JTAG. All compiled bitstreams, including partial ones, can be found in the build directory under **bitstreams**.

#### ~~User logic can be simulated by creating the testbench project :~~
~~~~
$ make sim
~~~~
The logic integration, stimulus generation and scoreboard checking should be adapted for each individual DUT.

## Build Driver

#### After the bitstream has been loaded, the driver can be compiled on the target host machine :
Note: Switch to FPGA server to make
~~~~
$ cd driver && make
zhu@alveo-u55c-01:~/Coyote/driver$ make
~~~~

#### ~~Insert the driver into the kernel (don't forget privileges) :~~
~~~~
$ insmod fpga_drv.ko
~~~~
~~Restart of the machine might be necessary after this step if the `util/hot_reset.sh` script is not working (as is usually the case).~~  
I don't and shouldn't restart the server. If there is some errors, call Dario or Max to hot-reset the target FPGA board only.

#### Generate ssh key (one server only once)
```
zhu@hacc-build-01:~$ ssh-keygen
zhu@hacc-build-01:~$ ssh-copy-id zhu@alveo-u55c-03
```

#### Insert the Driver
Note: Switch to build server to insert
```
zhu@hacc-build-01:~$ cd workspace/Coyote/
zhu@hacc-build-01:~/workspace/Coyote$  ./flow_alveo.sh hw/build/bitstreams/cyt_top driver 0
*** Enter server IDs:
3
*** Activating server ...
 **
[1] 17:06:48 [SUCCESS] alveo-u55c-03
*** Enabling Vivado hw_server ...
```

## Build `SW`
Note: Switch to FPGA server to make

What Runbin changed to do dlm test:
+ coyote/sw/include/
  - ibvQpConn.hpp
  - ibvQpMap.hpp
  - sLock.hpp

  - ibvQpConn.cpp
  - ibvQpMap.cpp

Note: /usr/bin/cmake ../ -DTARGET_DIR=examples/perf_dlm  
Available `sw` projects (as well as any other) can be built with the following commands :
~~~~
$ cd sw && mkdir build && cd build

## Additional requirements

If networking services are used, to generate the design you will need a valid [UltraScale+ Integrated 100G Ethernet Subsystem](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/cmac_usplus.html) license set up in `Vivado`/`Vitis`.
